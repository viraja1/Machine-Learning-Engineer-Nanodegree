Hence, you should expect to have 9 different outputs below — 3 for each model using the varying training set sizes. In the following code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",

Since no of data points is less, time is not an important factor. Also the test F1 score is high compared to the other models. Also SVM works well with high dimensional spaces. Also in this case, the no of features is less than no of data points. Since it uses a sub set of training points, it is memory efficient. In this case, no of data points is less. SVM works well with small amounts of data."

    "**Answer: ** SVM is classification technique that requires us to find a plane that separates two classes of data the best (student passed or failed) with maximum distance. Consider a set of colored marbles placed on a piece of paper (red and blue). You have to place a rope which separates the 2 colored marbles. Initially the 2 colored marbles are well separated. Therefore we were easily able to separate them by placing rope in the middle with adequate distance. If a new marble is placed, then the marbles can be separated with adequate distance by adjusting the rope. If new marbles were added such that they could not be separated with a vertical rope, then we find a new way which allows us to separate the marbles. This can be done by considering higher dimensions. Each dimension represents the student characteristics. Therefore higher dimensions represents various characteristics of the students. Once we consider the higher dimensions, we will notice that marbles are separated using a curved rope (not a straight line).Thus the SVM algorithm will place a rope around the groups to separate them. Thus when a new marble comes (student), SVM checks on which side of the rope the marble lies and hence determines the class (color) of the marble (pass or fail in case of students).\n",
